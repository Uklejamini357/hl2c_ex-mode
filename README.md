Does this have a readme? Doesn't seem like it, so I thought to add it. Though it's still quite unfinished

# Half-Life 2 Campaign: Eternal
### A fork of Half-life 2 campaign by Uklejamini, original by AMT

Welcome to HL2C Eternal.


What does this have? A lot of changes, including fixes for things that cause unexpected behavior. Keep in mind there's going to be a lot more to it, though!

## New stuff includes:
- EX Mode - A new way to play Half-Life 2, with NPC variants, map gimnicks, and more! This was one of the very first features I added to this fork!
- Hardcore Mode - It's just like survival mode, except you can't respawn at all! Failing the map will lead to failing the run, leading back to the beginning! Can you beat the entire Half-Life 2 with just one life?
- Bunnyhop - If just normal walking seems a bit boring to you and you need something to travel faster. No Accelerated Backhops though :(((
- Leveling and skills system - One of the RPG elements which allow you to upgrade your character to be more efficient!
- Prestige system! Unleash your truer potential with powerful perks.
- ^ With up to 3 prestige layers! This is for only if you feel like just having 1 prestige layer is not enough... (Endless mode only)
- Break Infinity! (Currently used for Difficulty and XP)
- And much more...

## Notes:
- You obviously need Half-Life 2 mounted for the maps, otherwise you won't be able to play them!
- While you can get hl2 maps from steam workshop on gmod, it's not recommended to do so.
- EP1 partially works, EP2 isn't expected to work fully.
- As this gamemode is still in development, expect random instability to occur update after update.
- This gamemode is maintained mostly for multiplayer, so if I break the gamemode in singleplayer, sorry about that.
