Â¿*Lore*m ipsum?

8 months before arrival of the Gordon Freeman, Dr. Breen has been talking to an unknown and mysterious creatures, requesting them to empower his combine forces by making them variants.
In exchange, XEN and Race X creatures will also become more powerful with its' various variants.
However, Dr. Breen has accepted the offer, regardless if it will bring more bad things to the world.

1 day later, all combines became more powerful, but another day later so the Xen creatures did.

However... as you become more powerful, things become a bit more... unstable
Thankfully in Pre-Prestige progression phase, nothing much bad happens


After Prestiging for the first time, you will see some creatures talking about your successful goal.
However before they can tell their own name you are interrupted by someone else.

After Eterniting for the first time, you will also see them again talking about your successful goal once again..
They tell you that with each prestige layer passed you're able to unlock more features.
However, the creatures also warn you not to go too far. Else if you do, there will be consequences.


EX Mode is preferred to be enabled for the best experience.
