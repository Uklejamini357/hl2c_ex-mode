I don't have time for making the update list at the moment.

0.7.9%9
Moneys. (Can be gained from killing NPCs, but it is only given after you have completed the map)
Added Eternity Upgrades. The pets were too much to code for them not to be targetted by friendlies.
Normal damage now follows the Minimum damage. (In case of a code error. Might limit some things a bit more but eh)
Following maps got a bit of changes in EX:
- d1_trainstation_01 (got updated earlier on 28-02-2025)
- d1_canals_01
- d1_eli_01
- d1_eli_02

Fall Damage is now affected by difficulty, and damage is also multiplied by max health*0.01 (minimum 1x)

Save Datas now uses JSON Tables (sorry if you got errors or your save got corrupted)

And the 6th, to be added in the future.... MythiLegendaries....?



0.7.9$9
Health now can go beyond 2147483648 (BETA)
Delayed damage can now  use up faster depending on amount of delayed damage left
